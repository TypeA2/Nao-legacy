# Nao
Nao is the wrapper for [libnao](https://github.com/TypeA2/libnao), written in C++ with [Qt 5.10.1](https://www.qt.io/).
It can be used to get some useful files out of the weird file formats used in games. Currently, support is limited to [NieR:Automataâ„¢](https://www.niergame.com/), but support will be added for other games in the future (and some games may already be ~~unintentionally~~ completely intentionally supported).

### Nao?
Trust me, there's a reason behind that name, but that doesn't mean I need to tell you.
